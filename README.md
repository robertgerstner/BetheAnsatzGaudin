In this project, I study the application of Young's Tableaux and the Bethe Ansatz for solving the Gaudin Hamiltonian 

$H = \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{\vec{\sigma}_i \cdot \vec{\sigma}_j}{\epsilon_i - \epsilon_j}$

for small numbers of spins.

The repository includes my written notes as well as Mathematica notebooks for my calculations.

Currently, the project only covers the simplest case of $N = 2$ spins.
